                <h1>Swami Vivekananda</h1>
                <h3>1863 - 1902</h3>

            <p class="para1">
                Swami Vivekananda was born on 12 January 1863. The Government of India declared this day as National
                Youth Day in 1984 and since then the day is celebrated in India every year. Born in Kolkata, death at
                the age of 39 (12th January 1863 - 4th July 1902), Vivekananda was famous for his ocean of knowledge,
                simplicity, futuristic outlook and high moral thoughts. The journey of a simple man, the man who
                symbolizes
                immense energy, courage and enthusiasm, Swami Vivekananda is not just merely a name, he was himself an
                institution. In a short span of lifetime his words inspire us in a such an extent that even after so
                many years of death, Vivekananda still remains in our hearts.
            </p>
            <p class="para2">
                With his futuristic vision he could understand that the country lives in discrimination. His teaching
                describes words against inequity on the basis of gender, religion, caste and creed. He was in pain
                seeing how women have been treated in our country. Vivekananda said women are the real strength of
                society and wanted
                women to be educated and independent. He was a true believer of women empowerment. Narendranath told if
                one wants to see the real India he has to walk through its streets. Vivekananda walked almost the whole
                country by foot as he believed human life is the supreme and superior of everything and he wanted to use
                his life to the fullest.
            </p>
            <p class="para3">
                Today the country is being smashed under the burden of poverty, unemployment,illiteracy, starvation and
                the list is endless. Sometimes countrymen feel helpless but is it unachievable dream of becoming great?
                Swamiji said a simple but significant "no" as the monk preached all the strength are crave for is within
                ourselves. He said, if we can overcome the pessimistic attitude we can do wonders. He advised to aim
                higher, work harder and not be scared of failure.

        <h3 class="msg">Message to the youth</h3>

        <div class="content">
            <p class="para4">
                Swami taught the world the importance of hard labour and that it is the only way one can achieve a goal.
                He said, one has to take the whole responsibility on one's shoulders. "Work as if on each of you
                depended the whole work. Fifty centuries are looking on you, the future of India depends on you. Work
                on."
                He told to see the work for the country not to see as a favour but an obligation. Vivekananda taught to
                be free from jealousy and suspicion and help people who want to be good.

                His wrote to one of his disciples, "Follow me, if you will, by being intensely sincere, perfectly
                unselfish, and, above all, by being perfectly pure. My blessings go with you. In this short life there
                is no time for the exchange of compliments. We can compare notes and compliment each other to our
                hearts.
            </p>
            <p class="para5">
                In Chicago, at the Parliament of the World's Religions held on September, 1893, Swami Vivekananda
                represented India and Hinduism. It was the first Parliament of the World's Religions and joined by the
                delegates from all over the world. Swami Vivekananda gave a speech on the importance of abolishing
                fanaticism in all forms, a relevant issue the world and one of the oldest countries India was facing.
                Vivekananda received a standing ovation for two minutes after finishing the speech which established him
                as the greatest figure in the Parliament of World Religions and India as the mother of religions.
